### Send Your Vertcoin From Exchange to Your Vertcoin Core Wallet
Most exchanges are centralized. When your coins are on these types of exchanges, the private keys are in control of the exchange and thus you do not technically own the coin. If the exchange were to lose your coins you would not be able to get them back. If you have not already set up your Vertcoin Core wallet, do so by going to the [Core wallet page](https://docs.vertcoin.org/Wallets/Core-Wallet/) located in the wallets section.

#### Create a Vertcoin Address on Vertcoin Core
It is recommended to always create a new address for every transaction. You may do so by opening Vertcoin Core, navigating to the `Receive` tab and selecting `Create new receiving address`. If you wish to re-use an existing address, you may go to `File -> Recieving Addresses`.
